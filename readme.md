# Delivery Staging OCR App

Description
This is an app used for verifying model and serial numbers on appliances that are staged for the next day's deliveries. It uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to verify the product and stores the serial number in a Firebase database, showing real-time data.

The app used bolt.new to AI generate the layout and main function. It has been tailored specifically for the company that uses it.
