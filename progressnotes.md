**Progress Notes**

notes:

results from testing
highlight rows with completed serial numbers
GE serial numbers sometimes have an extra letter at the end
sequoia, meridian, and hannegan are all mixed together (it would be nice to have meridian and sequoia on a separate list)

layout/logic - flag s/n area if manually entered
logic - preventing the same serial number entered twice if there are multiple quantities.

button to export file as csv (to store a back up on excel) - it kind of works
logic - if a process fails, a new picture can't be processed unless refreshed
logic - set levels of access based on IAM? admin/edit/read (concerned user level can press buttons that will alter stage list upload)
