**Progress Notes**

notes:
button to export file as csv (to store a back up on excel) - it kind of works
note to self - how to know how much space is taken up in github? if there are too big of files...
layout - scrolling on tablet left to right is too long
    -potentially fixed - test with tablet
layout/logic - flag s/n area if manually entered

logic - if a process fails, a new picture can't be processed unless refreshed

layout - highlight the stock button if not uploaded. also make it disappear when uploaded. there is lag time with the State

logic - set levels of access based on IAM? admin/edit/read (concerned user level can press buttons that will alter stage list upload)

logic - preventing the same serial number entered twice if there are multiple quantities.
